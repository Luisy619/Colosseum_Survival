### Report Grade (36.0/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

Motivation is more trial and error driven rather than linking properties of game and strengths of algorithms. Ideal organization should be Motivation -> Theoritical Description -> Technical Details -> Pros/Cons -> Future Improvements to make a coherent report. The report contains minor grammatical errors. The writing style is very verbose for the amount of information conveyed, thus hindering readability.
